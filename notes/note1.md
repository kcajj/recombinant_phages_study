# detecting recombinant phages

experiment explanation

## clones

Single phage isolates were taken from a recombinant population and they were sequenced. We assembled the sequencing reads to obtain the genome of the phage clone.

### SNPs distribution

We want to map on the clone genome the three references and see how the SNPs are distributed.

#### Pipeline

1. Map the ancestral sequences on the clone

2. Extract the SNPs from the alignment

3. Plot the SNP density of each ancestral sequence on the clone
